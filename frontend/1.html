        <h1>Way of Human</h1>
        <p>"Way of human is Vast and profound, many have tried it but none have managed to reach the end."<br> 
            LOL. I would have liked to say the above to sound like a wise experienced elder who have been through the storms and dust, oh well unfortunately for me and fortunately or everyone including me things are way too simple en not profound or mysterious at all.<br><hr><br>
            Way of life text intention is to give those who seek, abilities to cross death and keep in connection with those whose bodies no longer in contact with their spirit.<br><br>
        
            Text here won't give you anything that you don't already have or don't already know, It will only remind you of that you already know, at the very least Your spirit already know this things and more, I'm just exposing that I manage to piece together with intention to have others seek and create their path and discovery and hopefuly they will also share their discoveries with everyone, that way the path will be easier and broader to reach destination as when one of us stays behind then all of us will and do suffer because of that.<br><br>
            
        In all text contain here I ASK THAT YOU NOT FOLLOW ME, BUT WALK WITH ME, this is because the path changes what I see and experience as I seek and discover, does not take into consideration the changes that are brought about by my interferance .ie I record of the path en markers I see infront of me but im not writing about the changes the my food steps and experiment has left in the path behind me. In essence the path has changed to an extend, en someone following me word or word and footstep by footstep will get lost before they even start walking, hence use my words and text as a loose guidance not as direction as such find your path or create one if it doesnt exist. I only ask that you <em>not cause harm to any life form of any type</em> as harming others directly or indirectly is also harming all us including you, beside that tiny rule there are no other rules, everything goes.

        To reconnect with those who have move to spirit world is very simple :
        <ol>
            <li>Believe with no doubt that they are alive and kicking somewhere, in this case or now I will call the somewhere to be spirit world. Others will call it heaven, some hell, etc. <br> As far as heaven or hell or the idea and deinition of them is concerned, things are not evatly as such, this is because in heaven you find hell they are both just deinition of two opposite experiences, one is of bliss the other of discomfort and both those can be experienced in spirit world by all beings of all types, obviusly theres more to this experiences, but Book of human way is not meant to mention them in detail as they have no effect in the goal of the book.</li><br> <br> 
            <li>Think of them all the time always, I recommend you only remember pleasent things en endulge in the momeries.</li><br> <br> 
            <li>Yearn with all you being and existant to meet them again en chat or do things together. Your feelings should be intense enough that you are willing to sacrifise your existance and spirit just or that one chance to say 'Are you okay, are you being treated well'</li><br> <br> 
            <li>Remeber, its not about you, its about them, en your worry en concern of them</li>
        </ol><br> <br> <br>
