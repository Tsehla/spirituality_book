        <h1>Path of Masters</h1>
        <p>Everything I know, in depth. Intention is to have those who intent to path find have a better start than I had. <br>This book part will contain all other books, as all other books are just snippets taken rom this book to to empower everyone to fix an issure that should not be ignored and should have been long fixed by now.<br><br> 
        
        In the beginning the was only supposed to be this book, but after witnessing suffering of others, the two other books became reasonable to be made to fix specific issue.<br><hr><br>
